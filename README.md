# GIN2K-BOK-Tool
A prototypical visualization tool for the body of knowledge of Geographic Information Science &amp; Technology, based on d3.js

I created this visualization during project work at University Jaume I, Castellón de la Plana for the GI-N2K project (Geographic information: Need to Know, see http://www.gi-n2k.eu/). During subsequent development, it is aimed to become part of a browser-based tool for creating university curricula dedicated to Geographic Information Science.
